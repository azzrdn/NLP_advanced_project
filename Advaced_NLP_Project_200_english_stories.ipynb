He told his girlfriend that no one had tripped and stabbed him. She said he was lucky this time.   \"I\\'m not coming to this art fair again,\" said Molly. \"Why aren\\'t you coming to this art fair again?\" asked Teri. \"There aren\\'t enough visitors,\" Molly said. \"That\\'s for sure,\" said Teri. \"There aren\\'t enough visitors spending money.\" \"That\\'s for sure,\" said Molly. Visitors stopped and looked at Molly\\'s paintings. Visitors stopped and looked at Teri\\'s paintings. Visitors said Molly\\'s paintings were very nice. Visitors said Teri\\'s paintings were very nice. But no one bought anything. \"No one buys anything,\" said Molly. \"They stop. They look. They say, \\'Oh, how pretty.\\' Then they walk on.\" Molly and Teri had not sold one painting. They lowered their prices. They put \"Sale! 50% Off!\" tags on all their paintings. But no one bought a single painting.   The police chief said crime was down. \"Crime is down,\" said police chief Braddon. He talked to TV reporters. He talked to newspaper reporters. He talked to radio reporters. He was proud. \"I\\'m proud,\" he said. \"Our police are doing a good job. I\\'m proud of our police.\" He said crime was down 50 percent. \"What kinds of crime?\" asked a reporter. \"All kinds of crime,\" said Braddon. \"Bicycle theft is down 60 percent. Cell phone theft is down 55 percent. Computer theft is down 50 percent.\" He didn\\'t say anything about other crimes. \"What about other crimes?\" asked a reporter. \"What other crimes?\" asked Braddon. \"You should be happy with this news. Report it to the public. The public will be happy, too.\"   The man walked into a bank. He wore a hoody. He wore gloves. It was summertime. It was hot outside. No one else was wearing a hoody. No one else was wearing gloves. The bank guard looked at the man. \"Why are you wearing a hoody?\" the bank guard asked. \"Why are you wearing gloves?\" The man said he had a disease. He had a contagious disease. He coughed. He coughed again. The bank guard backed away. He did not want to get a disease. He stopped watching the man. He watched other people enter the bank. He forgot about the man with the contagious disease. A few minutes later, the man ran out of the bank. He was carrying a money bag.   Alex wanted to become a citizen. He signed up for a citizenship class. He went to the first class. The teacher spoke only Spanish. All the other students spoke only Spanish. Alex spoke Spanish, too. He asked the teacher, \"Why are you speaking Spanish? We need to speak English. We need to understand English. We need to read English. We need to write English.\" The teacher said, \"Don\\'t worry. English isn\\'t important anymore. My students never fail the interview. Can you say Yes in English? Can you say No in English? Then your English is good enough. You want to become a citizen. That is more important than your English.\" Alex dropped out. He signed up for another citizenship class. The teacher spoke only English.   His laptop sat on his desk. His laptop always overheated. It always overheated quickly. How could he keep it cool? He turned on his living room fan. It cooled his laptop. But the fan blew dust around. It blew paper around. He turned off his living room fan. He thought. He thought some more. How could he keep his laptop cool? He had an idea. He bought little plastic blocks. Each block was one inch square. He put the laptop on top of the blocks. One block was under each corner of the laptop. Now the laptop sat a little above the desk. There was space under the laptop. There was space for cool air to flow. The cool air prevented overheating.   The days were hot. The nights were hot. He turned on the living room fan. He turned on the dining room fan. Both fans were on high speed. They made a lot of noise. But they didn\\'t blow cool air. They blew hot air. They blew hot air everywhere. He turned off the fans. He turned on the air conditioner. He closed all the windows. He closed the front door. The apartment began to cool down. It got cooler and cooler. Then he heard a bang. It was a loud bang. He thought a plane had crashed onto the roof. But it wasn\\'t a plane. It was the air conditioner compressor. It had broken down. He opened the door. He opened the windows.   He couldn\\'t find his pen. Where is my pen, he wondered. He looked for his pen. It was on top of the microwave. He couldn\\'t find his cell phone. Where is my cell phone, he wondered. He looked for his cell phone. It was on top of the TV. He couldn\\'t find his glasses. Where are my glasses, he wondered. He looked for his glasses. They were on top of his head. I\\'m tired of looking for everything, he thought. He invented a tiny video recorder. It recorded everything he did. It recorded everywhere he went. He couldn\\'t find his toothbrush. Where is my toothbrush, he wondered. He played his tiny video recorder. He found his toothbrush. He didn\\'t have to look for it.   He called up the post office. \"Where is my package?\" he asked. \"What is the tracking number?\" the postal worker asked. He told her the tracking number. She said, \"Your package is at the main post office. You can pick it up anytime.\" He said, \"I don\\'t want to pick it up. Can you deliver it?\" She said yes. \"We will deliver it on Monday,\" she said. \"Will you be home?\" He said, \"What time on Monday?\" She said, \"Anytime between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.\" He said, \"I have to work. I can\\'t stay home all day.\" She said, \"That\\'s okay. We can deliver it on Tuesday.\" He said, \"I have to work on Tuesday, too. Please deliver it on Saturday.\"   He dropped his toothbrush. It fell on the floor. He picked up his toothbrush. He rinsed it off. He brushed his teeth. He rinsed his mouth. He walked out of the bathroom. He sat on his bed. He felt something. It was under the sheet. He took the sheet off the bed. Something was in his mattress. It was a brand new mattress. He had bought it yesterday. What is in the mattress, he wondered. He went to the kitchen. He took a knife from the kitchen drawer. He cut open the mattress. What could it be, he wondered. It was small. It was black. It was a book. It was the New Testament. Is God trying to tell me something, he wondered.   Some people stood on the small pier. They saw a boat approach. The boat was approaching fast. The boat was approaching the small pier. Was the boat going to stop? People started running. They started running off the pier. They were worried. They were worried about the boat. The boat kept coming. It didn\\'t slow down. One man stood on the pier. He didn\\'t run. He yelled at the boat. He waved his arms. He yelled, \"Stop! Stop! You\\'re going to crash!\" But the boat didn\\'t stop. It kept coming. The man kept yelling. The boat kept coming. Is the driver drunk, the man wondered. He ran as fast as he could. He ran off the pier. The boat crashed into the pier. '"
