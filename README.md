# NLP_advanced_project

> In this advanced nlp project, we will use short English essays available at "https://www.eslfast.com/supereasy/". 



The project basically:

1. web scraping,
2. Determining the verbs, adjectives and adverbs in the texts,
3. Determining the sentences in which verbs, adjectives and adverbs are used (5 pieces),
4. Finding the roots of these words,
5. Translation of the words and the 5 sample sentences they used into Turkish and Germany,
6. Finally, it includes a smooth export to the pdf file.



We use pandas, nltk , deep_translator and FDPF libraries in our project.


We first upload 200 essays to our computer with web-scraping. Then we will convert it into a dataframe in the form of title and content. This process is available in our jupyter notebook file named "web_scraping_for_200_english_stories.ipynb".
