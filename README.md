# NLP_advanced_project

### !! The outputs of the codes seem a bit long on github. If you want you can try to open it on google colab or your personal pc :)

### In this advanced nlp project, I will use short English essays available at **"https://www.eslfast.com/supereasy/"**. 



The project basically:

1. Web scraping,
2. Determining the verbs, adjectives and adverbs in the texts,
3. Determining the sentences in which verbs, adjectives and adverbs are used (5 examples),
4. Finding the roots of these words,
5. Translation of the words and the 5 sample sentences they used into Turkish and Germany,
6. Finally, it includes a smooth export to the pdf file.



I use pandas, nltk , deep_translator and FDPF libraries in this project.


I first upload 200 essays to my computer with web-scraping. Then I convert it into a dataframe in the form of title and content. This process is available in my jupyter notebook file named _**"web_scraping_for_200_english_stories.ipynb"**_.

My next actions are clearly in the file named _**"Advaced_NLP_Project_200_english_stories.ipynb"**_.
