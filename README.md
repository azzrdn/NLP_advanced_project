# NLP_advanced_project

### In this advanced nlp project, we will use short English essays available at "https://www.eslfast.com/supereasy/".

#### In our project, we will first upload 200 essays to our computer with web-scraping. Then we will convert it into a dataframe in the form of title and content. This process is available in our jupyter notebook file named "web_scraping_for_200_english_stories.ipynb".
